# CSC680-Project: Cal-Pal
an iOS application for SFSU's CSC680 course that tracks calories

Team: Jade Simien (JadeS01) & Arslan Alimov (ArslanAlimov)

Must have features:
```
* Calulate the amount of calories consumed throughout a day: utilize an API such as https://calorieninjas.com/api.
* Allow users to set calorie goals and calculate if they've reached that goal or went under/over it.
* Display a chart of a given week's daily calories.
* Allow users to log their food/calories under breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack categories.
```

Nice to have features:
```
* Users can register/log in: use SQLite
* A water tracker/reminder feature where users can determine how many glasses of water they want daily
  and adjust the frequency of the reminders.
* A pie chart showing the user's logged food category sizes. For example, they'll be able to see if
  they tend to have bigger dinners compared to a smaller breakfast or tend to eat more snacks.
* Users can personalize the app's color scheme.
* Pictures of foods that users consumed.
```

Jade:
```
* Set up the UI depicted in the wireframes including hamburger menu. (3-4 hours)
* Pass data, such as a desired calorie goal and histogram, between view controllers. (3-4 hours)
```

Basic wire-frames for the main feature:
